This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=346

This was the original vim php indent file written in 2002 and included in Vim 6.X releases.

Indents after <?php tag, <? tag (optional), ( )or { }.  The script can also format switch/case statements and more recently will automatically format /* comment sections */

It likes the following format:
<pre>
    if($something)
    {
         dothis();
    }
</pre>
It was not designed to and will not handle if blocks etc. without braces and also does not format html.  Please use braces and separate display logic for more readable code.
